## 🚀 Flash Cards With Chat GPT

Together with Rocketseat's Nitro project, we developed the Flash Cards layout. However, I thought about using this layout to integrate with ChatGPT to create some cards. I also included some alternatives so that it makes me think about which options are true. Using artificial intelligence, it helped the project to have cards on any subject and being unlimited in relation to the subject.
